            <h2>Mean Value Theorm (MVT)</h2>
            <p>In mathematics, the mean value theorem (or Lagrange theorem) states, roughly, 
            that for a given planar arc between two endpoints, there is at least one 
            point at which the tangent to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints. 
            It is one of the most important results in real analysis. This theorem is used to prove statements 
            about a function on an interval 
            starting from local hypotheses about derivatives at points of the interval.</p>

            <h2>L'Hôpital's rule</h2>
            <p> L'Hôpital's rule states that for two points t and c such that t -> c, the slope of a curve when t = c is the limit of the slope of the tangent 
                to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.</p>

            <h2>Taylor Series</h2>
            <p>In mathematics, the Taylor series or Taylor expansion of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are 
                expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, 
                the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. 
                Taylor series are named after Brook Taylor, who introduced them in 1715. A Taylor series is also called a 
                Maclaurin series when 0 is the point where the derivatives are considered, after Colin Maclaurin, 
                who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the mid-18th century.</p>

            <h2>Formal definition of continuity</h2>
            <p> For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, 
                and the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point.</p>
